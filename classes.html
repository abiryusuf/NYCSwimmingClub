		<p>It is never too late to learn to swim.  Regular swimming builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness.  Itâ€™s a low-impact activity that can serve as a cross-training component or a change of pace to go along with your regular fitness plan.  We offer a beautiful 25-yard Junior Olympic-sized lap pool, one of the few found in NYC.</p>
